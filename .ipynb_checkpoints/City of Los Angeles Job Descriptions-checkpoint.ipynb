This review may include the evaluation of the candidate's training, experience, personal qualifications, and findings of the background investigation as they prepared the candidate for the job of Firefighter. Based on hiring needs, those candidates with the strongest qualifications will receive a conditional job offer from the Fire Department and be scheduled for the medical and psychological evaluation.
